# TocmaiKit

A minimal Kirby CMS starter with a folder structure inspired by [ComposerKit](https://github.com/getkirby/composerkit/).

## Features

* Multi-language enabled, with Romanian as the default language and English as a secondary language under the `/en/` URL namespace.
* Config overrides for `localhost`.
* Basic admin bar.
* Translations managed from a plugin (as to not expose them to panel users).
* Global navigation menus.
* Helper functions for localized date/time.
* Maintenance mode.
